inside of it insert it\ninto your computer and then it was yours\nto keep forever but then one day the\ndevil got a job as a product manager at\na software company and had this clever\nidea called SAS or software as a service\nwhen you buy it you don't actually own\nit and just rent it for a monthly fee\nuntil the day you die this caused\nprofits to go parabolic and nowadays\ncompanies are looking to squeeze the\nlemon even harder like pelaton is going\nto charge a $95 reactivation fee if you\nbuy a used bike on Craigslist Logitech\nis looking to roll out a pay as youo\nMouse which gives a new meaning to pay\nper click an adobe was recently sued by\nthe FTC for its predatory hidden early\ntermination fees the only world that\ndoesn't have this problem is Temple OS\nbut the reality is that nobody is\nforcing you to buy these products in a\nfree market and the best way to escape\nsubscription hell is to use free and\nopen source software Alternatives that\nthese big companies don't want you to\nknow about before we get into it make\nsure to draw and quarter that like\nbutton and put the subscription button's\nhead on a pike it really helps out the\nchannel aside from Windows itself which\ncan easily be replaced by Linux the most\nprofitable software of all time is\nlikely Microsoft Office they get kids\nhooked on it in grade school so they can\ngrow up to spin the hamster wheels that\nchurn out Microsoft profits luckily\nthough there's a free and open source\nversion called Libra office which can do\nalmost everything that word excel and\nPowerPoint do and is compatible with a\ncrazy number of file formats even\ndumpster fires like docx but it is\nmissing some features from Microsoft\nOffice like it doesn't require an\ninternet connection to invade your\nprivacy it doesn't automatically upload\nyour documents to the cloud where they\ncan someday be breached by hackers or\nfeds and it doesn't have a bunch of AI\ngarbage built into it if you really want\nthose features you should continue to\npay Microsoft but if you're looking for\nFreedom Libre is the tool now many teams\nhave escaped Microsoft Office only to\nland in other paid tools like air table\nwhich itself is a pretty awesome tool\nbut extremely expensive at $45 per month\nper seat what's crazy though is you\ncould likely support hundreds of users\non your own VPS for just a few dollars\nper month by self-hosting Nob it stores\ndata in your favorite SQL database but\nturns all the tables into Rich\nspreadsheets which is ideal for\ncollaboration but when your boss tells\nyou to stop collaborate and listen\nYou'll likely need to use a note-taking\napp like notion which is another $10 per\nmonth once again there's an open source\nalternative called app flowy which is\nwritten in Rust and flutter not only is\nthe UI beautiful and can do things like\nnote taking con bonds and calendars but\nnoi's most recent Innovation was to shoe\nhorn AI into the platform well app flowy\ncan do that too and even let you choose\nyour own llm provider that's pretty\nawesome but you might be wondering how I\nfind out about all these amazing open\nsource tools one incredible resource is\ndaily. deev the sponsor of today's video\nit's a website and rapidly growing\ncommunity that curates the best\ndeveloper content on the internet and\nthe app itself is a free and open source\nproject not only will you find the\nhottest developer Trends here but you\ncan also find tune your interest by\njoining squads where you'll find other\nexperienced developers openly discussing\nthe tech you care about the most and\nit's not just a bunch of anonymous Bots\nthese are real people from the real\nworld that you can network with to land\na job in real life whether you're\nlearning to code or just interested in\nTech daily. deev is a website that every\ndeveloper should visit on The Daily but\nnow it's time to talk about another\nmassive software Juggernaut called\nSalesforce they provide customer\nrelationship management software that\nallows salespeople to strategically\nannoy you until you buy something\nthere's a bunch of good open- source\ncrms but one that stands out is Erp next\nwhich is not only a CRM but also an\nenterprise resource planning tool which\ncan handle accounting quality control\nand a bunch of other stuff it's written\nin Python and also maintains its own\ncustom web framework called frappe but\nmost importantly you can run it in 2\nminutes with Docker and cancel your\nmulti-million dollar Salesforce\ncontracts now Salesforce also acquired\nthe popular chat app slack for 27\nbillion yet another application that you\nreally don't need to be paying for a\nbetter option is to use a tool like\nmattermost which is built with go and\ntypescript and can be deployed as a\nsingle binary with a postgress database\nnot only is it packed with features for\nchat but also has integrated voice and\nvideo chat it has front-end clients for\nthe web iOS Android and desktop but most\nimportantly it gives you total control\nover your data a company like slack\ncan't hold your data hostage and demand\na ransom to get it back but another\nthing you might be paying for that\ndoesn't even need to store data is zoom\nback in the pandemic days I once built\nmy own video conferencing app from\nscratch with web RTC and JavaScript but\nan even easier approach is to use an\nopen source tool like jitsy it uses web\nRTC under the hood to handle voice\ncalling but also provides a ton of other\nFe features like mobile applications\nraised hands polls virtual backgrounds\nand everything else you would expect\nfrom a zoom alternative but if you're\nunfortunate enough to be a professional\ndeveloper your scrub Master is likely\ntortured you with a device called jira\nwhich forces you to do Sprints epics\nburnd downs and tickets well the good\nnews is that there's a tool called plane\nthat makes this torture device free and\nopen source it's a torture device for\ndevelopers by developers but if you're\ndeveloping something you might be using\na tool like Firebase a bass which stands\nfor big ass backend now I like big back\nends and I cannot lie but I also don't\nlike paying for them and being locked\ninto a close- source platform nowadays\nthere are many great open source\nAlternatives like convex aight superbase\npocket base but there's a newcomer you\nlikely haven't heard of called instant\nit's not a full backend but if you're\nlooking to build a real-time chat or\ncollaboration tool it handles the client\nserver sync challenges for you which is\na lot of work to do correctly on your\nown but one thing that's relatively easy\nto do on your own is host a website yet\nmany developers choose to pay companies\nlike forell or Heroku a high premium to\ndo this for them you can avoid these\ntaxes with tools like kifi the versel\nalternative or daku the Heroku\nalternative you can use tools like this\nto self-host all of the amazing projects\nthat we've looked at so far in this\nvideo on a single virtual private server\nyou get the UI and apis of a premium\nhosting platform just without the\nmassive bills and free toer rug Poes but\nnow we need to talk about perhaps the\nmost greedy software developer Adobe I\nspeak to you as a hypocrite though as I\nedit this video in Adobe Premiere for\nwhich I pay a $59 monthly tribute as a\nfree human being though I could trade\nAdobe suite for pirated Adobe suite or\nbetter yet trade premiere for Da Vinci\nresolve and trade illustrator for Crea\nand trade after effects for blender\nvirtually every SAS product has a free\nand open- Source self-hosted alternative\nnever paying for software again is going\nto be a challenge but remember as\ndevelopers we don't do things because\nthey are easy we do them because we\nthought they were going to be easy\nthanks for watching and I will see you"
